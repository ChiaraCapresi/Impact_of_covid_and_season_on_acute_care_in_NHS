# Plots to make

A time series line graph, with date along the bottom (month or quarter, tbc), and KPI measure on y-axis. From 2018(or earlier) until now. **requires data cleaning step to convert month/quarter to datetime class**

Including a line for "all health boards" - tbc whether an average or aggregate for the KPI. **requires data wrangling step to make this summary data**
_We could make a static plot of all hbs to display alongside an interactive plot to select HBs; such that all HBs is not needed in the input selector._

With a filter for health board (so we can filter for 1 or multi-select for 1+).

# Hospital admissions

The following three datasets collect data about number of hospital admissions from 2020 to 2023. The number of hospital admissions is here registered weekly. For each of them, we have informations about hb, weekly hospital admissions and average and percentage of hospital admissions during the precovid (period 2018/2019). In addition to that, each of the three files contains informations respectively about demographics of patients, simd quintile and specialty.

```{r}
ha_demo <- read_csv("../data/covid/hospital_admissions/hospital_admissions_hb_agesex_20230706.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

ha_simd <- read_csv("../data/covid/hospital_admissions/hospital_admissions_hb_simd_20230706.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

ha_specialty <- read_csv("../data/covid/hospital_admissions/hospital_admissions_hb_specialty_20230706.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

```

### Wrangling data operations.

First of all, I create a column called 'month_ending_date', which I want have a data format and contains simply the month, in this way I will be able to group the data by month and make the dataset s√¨consistent with the other datasets.

```{r}
ha_demo <- ha_demo %>% 
  mutate(month_ending_date = ym(str_sub(as.character(week_ending), start = 1, end = 6)), .after = week_ending) %>% 
  mutate(week_ending = ymd(week_ending))


ha_simd <- ha_simd %>% 
  mutate(month_ending_date = ym(str_sub(as.character(week_ending), start = 1, end = 6)), .after = week_ending) %>% 
  mutate(week_ending = ymd(week_ending))


ha_specialty <- ha_specialty %>% 
  mutate(month_ending_date = ym(str_sub(as.character(week_ending), start = 1, end = 6)), .after = week_ending) %>% 
  mutate(week_ending = ymd(week_ending))
```

## heatmap for occupancy

* is there hospitals in the data? yes
* need to collapse value for all specialties to get to one value per location; what will "all of scotland" map look like??
