```{r}
delayed <- clean_names(read_csv("delayed-discharge-beddays-health-board.csv"))

Initial clean:  not interested in delay reasons,
                remove qualifier rows

```{r}
delayed <- delayed %>% 
  filter(reason_for_delay == "All Delay Reasons") %>% 
  select(month_of_delay,
         hbt,
         age_group,
         number_of_delayed_bed_days,
         average_daily_number_of_delayed_beds)
```


```{r}
delayed <- delayed %>% 
  mutate(month_of_delay = ym(month_of_delay))
```



```{r}
delayed %>% 
  filter(age_group == "18plus") %>% 
  group_by(hbt)
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = month_of_delay,
      y = average_daily_number_of_delayed_beds) +
  geom_line()
```
