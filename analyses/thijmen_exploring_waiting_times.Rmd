Goal: looking at waiting times at A&E
1. NumberofattendancesAll
2. Numberwithin 4 hours
3. Number over 4 hours
```{r}
waiting_times <- read.csv("data/a_and_e/monthly_ae_activity_202305.csv")
```

```{r}
# open libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
waiting_times_1 <- clean_names(waiting_times)
```

```{r}
#explore data
head(waiting_times)
glimpse(waiting_times)
view(waiting_times_1)
colnames(waiting_times_1)
```

```{r}
waiting_times_1 %>% 
  distinct(country)
# only a single country = Scotland

waiting_times_1 %>% 
  distinct(department_type)
# 2 departments only, injury and emergency (=A&E)


waiting_times_1 %>% 
  select(month, hbt, number_of_attendances_all) %>% 
  mutate(month_new = ym(month)) %>% 
  group_by(hbt) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = month_new, group = hbt) +
  geom_histogram((aes(fill = hbt))
  
#group by hbt, and/or location, and/or department
  
  
```



```{r}
#create a barplot with per month have the number of attendances in total

```
